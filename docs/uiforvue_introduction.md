# Progress<sup>®</sup> Kendo UI for Vue

The Kendo UI for Vue is part of the Kendo UI suite for jQuery.

It provides an easy way to use and configure Kendo UI widgets in your Vue.js application. This means that although you might be using Vue directives or components to set up the user interface with Kendo UI, the underlying functionality of the UI controls comes from the Kendo UI for jQuery suite.

For more information, refer to the [official documentation on Kendo UI for Vue](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-vue-ui/components/).
