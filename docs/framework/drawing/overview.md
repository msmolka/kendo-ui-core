# Drawing Overview

The [Kendo UI Drawing library (Drawing API)](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/drawing/index) is a cross-browser vector graphics library and provides a simple object model for building and manipulating visual scenes.

The Kendo UI Drawing API is designed to serve as a foundation of and extension point for the Kendo UI widgets rendering data visualization, such as Charts and Diagrams. The library is also a standalone component that is suitable for building custom visualizations.

To build a scene, you can create drawing elements such as curves, images, and text. Scene elements are live and respond to changes of their appearance and geometry. To render scenes on and off screen, use the drawing surface. Surfaces encapsulate specific browser technologies such as SVG or Canvas.
