# Column Menu

The Grid provides a built-in option for triggering column operations through a menu.

To enable the column-menu implementation, set `columnMenu=true`. As a result, the column headers of the Grid render a column menu which allows the user to sort, filter, or change the visibility of the column. The column menu also detects when a specific column operation is disabled through the column definition and excludes the corresponding UI from its rendering. For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on implementing a column menu in the Grid](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/grid/column-menu).
